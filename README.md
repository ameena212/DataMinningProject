# DataMinningProject - IT8416
In this project, Rapid Minner and R studio tools were used to mine a diabetes prediction dataset.

Motivation
Diabetes is a common health issue worldwide that is caused by high blood sugar levels. It is a chronic illness that is difficult to diagnose and intervene early due to the complex relationships between various medical factors. Every year, diabetes death rates increase significantly. According to the World Health Organization in 2023, “In 2019, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths.”. Consequently, detecting diabetes at an early stage and preventing or delaying its consequences can save millions of lives and improve their quality of life.

Objectives
The aim is to analyze the Diabetes prediction dataset to build a model that is helpful for medical experts to detect diabetes sooner by using medical and demographic data to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes based on their lifestyle changes. Moreover, writing a detailed analysis of the dataset by discovering patterns and factors relationships will assist in enhancing patients’ well-being. Furthermore, Analysis of Diabetes Risk by evaluating the factors and their contribution to the disease may increase life expectancy.

 Problem Statement / Project Definition
Motivated by the need to advance diabetes treatment and prevention, the goal is to empower doctors with useful knowledge to aid patients by designing a model with accurate diabetes prediction using people’s health history.

Expected Result 
As a result, a transparent model will be capable of predicting diabetes with high accuracy. Therefore, healthcare specialists should be able to interpret the model, so they can understand the factors that contribute to the prediction. Also, several medical and statistical variables will be examined in this project to highlight their influence on diabetes risk.
